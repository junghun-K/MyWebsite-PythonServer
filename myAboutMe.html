      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Jeonghoon Kim, preferably <strong>Ken</strong> from South Korea.
        I am a senior majoring in computer science at the U of M and expected to graduate in Spring 2023 (next semester).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been learning computer science since 2016 and started with Java but my major language is python.
        I am learning programming because I can do so many things with it.
        One of my interests is machine learning and deep learning I can analyze the data to predict something.
        Before I join the army in 2018, I started web programming myself. I have learned HTML, CSS, and scratched JS
        I have experienced a little bit of front-end and back-end.
        I built an online shopping website, and API to learn what the backend is.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I have to build something, I would like to build a website that represents me, so this assignment is fairly what I wanted to do.
        I enjoy playing soccer and swimming for staying healthy since many university students have bad eating habits and do not exercise due to school loads.
        My favorite activity over the summer is surfing, which I did during the summer vacation in my home country.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning ML and DL and want to become a <em>data scientist</em>, but I am also considering <em>web-developer</em> and <em>app developer</em> due to high demands in the job market.
        Therefore, this course might help me find what I really want to do after graduation, which makes me so excited!!!
